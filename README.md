##Array checker
* Array of integers is given
* x is a number from the array
* We jump x positions in the array from current positions either forward or backward; if that position is not visited we repeat this jump sequence unless all the positions on array are covered; else we move to next x number in the array.
* If all the array positions are covered by that x without violeting the condition, then we store that x in answer table.
* This answer table is the output
